Mobile Price Range Prediction Capstone Project

Project Overview:
Analyzed mobile phone data to predict price ranges based on various features, such as RAM, internal memory, and battery power. The goal was to help understand what drives mobile phone prices in a competitive market.

Key Responsibilities:

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify important features and correlations.
Built and evaluated several models including Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes.
Tuned hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
Key Findings:

The most significant factors affecting mobile phone prices are RAM, battery power, and pixel resolution.
Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine were the best-performing models with high accuracy and F1 scores.
Technologies Used:
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

This project allowed me to apply machine learning techniques to real-world data, showcasing my ability to build predictive models and derive actionable insights for pricing strategies.
